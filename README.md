# CRNN

A TensorFlow implementation of https://github.com/bgshih/crnn

## But what is a CRNN?

It is a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network that can be used as an OCR

## What training data was used?

All training data (200 000 examples) were generated using my other project https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator

To do the same, simply clone that project and do `python3 run.py -c 200000 -w 1 -t 8`. `-t` should be your processor thread count.

## Pretrained model

Coming soon.
